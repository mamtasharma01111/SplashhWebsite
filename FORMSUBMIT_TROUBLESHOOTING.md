# FormSubmit Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Forms are not sending emails after activation

### What I've Fixed:

1. **Updated all forms to use consistent FormSubmit URLs:**
   - Contact form: `https://formsubmit.co/el/confirm/splashhresorts@gmail.com`
   - Banquet form: `https://formsubmit.co/el/confirm/splashhresorts@gmail.com`
   - Rooms form: `https://formsubmit.co/el/confirm/splashhresorts@gmail.com`
   - Testimonial form: Already correct

2. **Fixed form redirects:**
   - Contact form → `contact-success.html`
   - Banquet form → `banquet-success.html`
   - Rooms form → `booking-success.html`
   - Testimonial form → `testimonial-success.html`

3. **Improved JavaScript form handling:**
   - Fixed validation conflicts
   - Added proper reply-to field handling
   - Improved form submission flow

### Steps to Resolve:

#### 1. Activate Your Email with FormSubmit

- Click the activation link from FormSubmit
- You should see a success message

#### 2. Test the Simple Form
- Open `test-form.html` in your browser

#### 3. Check Email Settings
